The following libraries are required for BGP parser:

* python >= 2.7
* libxml-2.0
* boost at least version 1.44
** boost-system
** boost-filesystem
** boost-program_options
** boost-regex
** boost-iostreams
* (optional, disabled by default) log4cxx

In FreeBSD these dependencies can be installed using ports:
* textproc/libxml2
* devel/boost-libs
* devel/log4cxx 

For example, if `portupdate' port is installed, run the following:
  portupgrade -N libxml2 boost-libs log4cxx

!!! Due to design bug/feature, log4cxx crashes on exit when used in
multiprocessor environment (see LOGCXX-322).  Until log4cxx-0.10.1 released
which hopefully resolve the issue, it is recommended to use the "hacked"
version from git.

see https://github.com/cawka/log4cxx/commit/544911a77cdb071f629a628f539d6809b8cf5a9f

git clone https://cawka@github.com/cawka/log4cxx.git
cd log4cxx
./autogen.sh
./configure
make && make install


Installation:
-------------

./waf configure
./waf build
sudo ./waf install

The binary is called bgpparser and placed under the $prefix/bin/ directory

!!!! Attention OSX users !!!!
If you're using a non-apple version of gcc, for example compiled using
Macports, Boost library *have to* be build with the same version of the
compiler.  In short, you cannot use Macport's version of Boost if you're using
Macport's version of gcc.
